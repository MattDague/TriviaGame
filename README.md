# TriviaGame

Welcome to my trivia game based on the television show The Office. This is very challenging quiz meant for the truest of fans so don't be discouraged if its too hard.

To get started simply click the start button which will start the timer of only 2 minutes. There are 8 total questions, each with 4 possible answers. If the time runs out or the submit button is clicked the ending page will display. That page contains the total amount of right answers, wrong answers and your percentage score. Clicking reset here will start the game over and give a chance for a better score.
